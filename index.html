			<p>Hi, my name is Pat and I have many hobbies.  Some are creative, some are dangerous, and some are relaxing. I also love
				my job.  I work as a database developer, data engineer, data warehouse engineer....you get the idea.  I am currently
				attending a full-stack web development bootcamp through UC Berkeley.  You ask "Why would you do that if you love your job?".  Well, my job has changed a lot over the years and it is not sufficient to have only data skills.  Many data professionals now write APIs, scripts, and programs using object-oriented languages.  They may also be required to hook up a website to a database.  I believe that full-stack web development skills will help my career enormously.
